# Renewable electricity spatial allocation model - RESAM

The RESAM concept aims at assessing different policy scenarios to govern the land-use for energetic purposes under the constraint of ensuring the electricity supply for a virtual landscape with renewable energy sources (RES). To derive ‘optimal’ spatial allocation the agent-based modelling approach is implemented which includes a virtual landscape, three settlements as demand centres and profit-oriented producers of renewable power. For the design of the electricity grid and the calculation of grid-related reinforcement costs a load-flow model is applied being also able to map grid externalities during the RES expansion in space.

RES producers are allowed to choose profit-maximising cells for plant installations until the given demand for power of the virtual landscape is met. Different policy scenarios allocate particular costs to agents (e. g. grid reinforcement costs, spatial externalities) or restrict the land-use with respect to ecological or social restraints. The overall efficiency of allocation (total cost level) as well as the distributional fairness (regional net costs) are evaluated for the policy scenarios.
The model has been developed as part of a Phd thesis within the realm of the intergraded projected EnergyLandUse which has been rolled out by the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Leipzig.
